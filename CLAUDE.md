## Application Architecture

This is a Rails 8 invoicing application for managing clients and their associated billing rates. The system tracks client information, billing rates over time, and client sessions.

### Core Domain Models:

1. **Client**:
   - Represents a client with contact information (name, address, email)
   - Has associated fee records that track billing rates over time
   - Has associated client sessions for time tracking

2. **Fee**:
   - Represents a billing rate for a specific time period
   - Has start and end dates (`from` and `to` fields)
   - Tracks the hourly charge rate (stored using the Money gem)
   - Current rates have a `nil` end date

3. **ClientSession**:
   - Represents billable time spent with a client
   - Tracks the session date (`session_date` field) and duration in minutes
   - Associated with a client and optionally an invoice
   - Stores the hourly rate applicable at the time of the session

4. **Invoice**:
   - Represents a billing document sent to clients
   - Contains multiple client sessions
   - Tracks status (created, sent, paid)

### Key Functionality:

1. **Rate Management**:
   - Client rates can change over time
   - The system maintains a history of rate changes
   - Prevents overlapping fee periods
   - Current rate is always available via the `current_rate` method

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validates required client fields (name, email, address1, town, postcode)
   - Validates postcode format using UK-style format
   - Ensures fee periods don't overlap
   - Validates rate change data integrity

3. **Session Management**:
   - Tracks client sessions with date and duration
   - Calculates fees based on the client's rate and session duration
   - Sessions can be grouped into invoices for billing

### View Conventions:

1. **Date Formatting**:
   - All dates are displayed using UK convention (day month year)
   - Example: "31 May 2025" instead of "May 31, 2025"
   - Dates are formatted using `strftime("%d %B %Y")`

2. **Currency Formatting**:
   - Money values use the UK pound symbol (Â£)
   - Formatted using the Money gem and `number_to_currency` helper

### Testing Strategy:

The application uses RSpec with FactoryBot for testing. Factory definitions include:
- Basic client factory
- Client with random name
- Client with fee history
- Client with session history

Tests cover validation rules, rate calculation logic, and fee period management.

## Implementation Notes

- The application uses Rails 8.0.2
- Uses SQLite for development and test environments
- Uses the Money gem for currency handling
- Uses Solid gems (solid_cache, solid_queue, solid_cable) for caching, job queues, and ActionCable
- RSpec and FactoryBot are used for testing
- Uses rubocop-rails-omakase for Ruby style enforcement
