# Include Reminder for Unpaid Invoices in Invoice Drafts

When generating the invoice, check for unpaid invoices and if any exist,
add a reminder for the unpaid invoices to the text field of the invoice draft.

This allows the user to amend or delete the reminder text if needed.

Create unit and system tests for this feature to ensure it works as expected.
